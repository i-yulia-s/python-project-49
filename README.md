This is a set of simple math games:
- Evens: guess if suggested number is even
- Calculations: calculate the result of suggested expression
- Greatest Common Divisor: find GCD of suggested numbers
- Progression: find the number omitted from arithmetic progression
- Primes: guess if suggested number is a prime
